# Orchard Core Framework

Pre-requisite: Make sure you download .NET Core SDK 2.2 (`2.2.100`) otherwise below examples won't work. 

This section contains samples of project relying on [Orchard Core Framework](https://orchardcore.readthedocs.io/en/dev/). This section is a bit more advanced than the other parts of Practical ASP.NET Core.

Orchard Core Framework is interesting because it provides infrastructure to modularize your application. It also go further in providing facilities to create multi tenant application, which is super hard to get right if you start from scratch.

Orchard Core Framework powers Orchard Core CMS - you can use the framework independently on systems that have nothing to do with content management.

Notes:

- To run a sample, go to each sample folder and go to the `Host` folder. 
- All module will have `Module` prefix.
- We wil be using beta 3 version of Orchard Core.
